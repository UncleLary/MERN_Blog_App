# MERN_Blog_App
Webb blog application coded in MERN stack(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Nodejs).

I used JWT tokens to authorize registartion/logging/managing posts.
Passwords are stored salted and hashed.
I used REST architecture, validation of user input is done both on the client&server side.

User can Create/Update/Delete/Edit(CRUD) post if he is its author.
CRUD operations are also avaiable on account.
